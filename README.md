# Super-Poster
Super Poster is a generated poster system built by processing with a graphical user interface library — controlP5.This is an open source project created for designers and engineers or amateurs that everyone can download the source files for free in my Github account and modifies the code to build their own design system.The aim is to make the design more systematic and flexible.  ControlP5 is a library written by Andreas Schlegel for the programming environment processing. Last update, 07/30/2015.  Controllers to build a graphical user interface on top of your processing sketch include Sliders, Buttons, Toggles, Knobs, Textfields, RadioButtons, Checkboxes amongst others and can be easily added to a processing sketch. They can be arranged in separate control PGraphics contexts, and can be organized in tabs or groups.
The system has a total of two modes corresponding to different poster compositions. The SUPER SHAPE pattern in the poster is a 3D graphic made up of functions, and the shape of the different patterns changes depending on the value.

After you finish producing the poster, you can save the png version directly, or you can use the code from saveFrame () to create the dynamic poster.
